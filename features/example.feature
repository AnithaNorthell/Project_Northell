#   Scenario: Validate various element states
#     Given I navigate to "https://demo.automationtesting.in/Register.html"
#     Then Element "#submitButton" should be visible
#     Then Element "#disabledField" should be disabled
#     Then Element "#enabledField" should be enabled
#     Then Element ".success-message" should contain text "Success"
#     Then Element ".title" text should equal "Registration Form"
#     Then Element "#colorBox" should have RGB color "rgb(255, 0, 0)"
#     Then Element "input[type='email']" should have attribute "type" with value "email"
